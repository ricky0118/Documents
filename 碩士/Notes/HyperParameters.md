# HyperParameters

The value of parameters ==depends on the designer==, then that parameter calls "**[[HyperParameters| HyperParameter ]]**".

## List of HyperParameters

### Learning Rate
It's to determine the ==learning speed== during the training.
$$\eta \frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta}|_\rm{\theta = \theta^0}$$

### Number of Activate Function
It's mean need how many activate function in the model to approach the data. It will determine the limit of the model.

### Batch Size
To determine the split size of all data.
