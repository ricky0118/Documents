# Model

Model is the mathematical relation(function) between the input layer and output layer. And the type of mathematical function will depend on domain knowledge.

## For example

The following equation is the most traditional linear regression model. $x_1$ is the input of the model, called "**Feature**". And $y$ is the output of the model.

$$y=b+\rm{w}x_1$$

There have two parameters that are unknown. One is multiplied with the input layer, called "**Weight**". And the other is added to the end, called "**Bias**".
