# [[Machine Learning]]

Machine Learning is a function of ==**Looking for a [[#Some types of Functions| Function]]**==. For example, the function input of Image Recognition must be an image, and the output of the function is the object name in the image.

## [[#Some types of Functions]]

### 1. Regression:

- The function outputs a (or some?) scalar(s).

### 2. Classification:

- Given some options(Classes), and the function outputs the correct one.
- Ex:
    1. Spam filtering: input the email and output Yes or No.
    2. Alpha Go: output the location of the next step(19 by 19 chooses).

### 3. Structured Learning:

- Output object with a structure like an image, document, sound...etc.

# The step of Learning

1. Find out the [[Model| mathematical model]].
2. Define [[Loss Function| Loss function]]
3. [[Optimization ]]
