# Neural Network
Neural Network is similar on the linear regression and ==***biological neuron***==, but there have a big different between both. Following is the equation of one layer neural network
$$a = B + W\rm{x}$$
$a$ and $\rm{x}$ are the **input and output vector** of the neural network. $W$ is the **weight matrix**, and $b$ is the **bias matrix**.

## [[Activation function|Activation Function]]
The activation function is like a switch of a node in a ==artificial [[Neural Network| neural network]]==. However, the nonlinear activation functions can allow the network to compute a complex problem using only a small number of nodes.
